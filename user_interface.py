```python
# user_interface.py

from flask import Flask, render_template, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def user_dashboard():
    # Code to retrieve user's tasks, upcoming meetings, and outreach/negotiation status
    tasks = get_user_tasks()
    meetings = get_upcoming_meetings()
    outreach_status = get_outreach_status()
    negotiation_status = get_negotiation_status()
    
    return render_template('dashboard.html', tasks=tasks, meetings=meetings, outreach_status=outreach_status, negotiation_status=negotiation_status)

@app.route('/customize')
def customize_appearance():
    # Code to retrieve user's preferred theme and customize the appearance of the application
    theme = get_user_theme()
    
    return render_template('customize.html', theme=theme)

@app.route('/responsive')
def responsive_design():
    # Code to handle responsive design
    
    return render_template('responsive.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```
Note: This code assumes that you have HTML templates named 'dashboard.html', 'customize.html', and 'responsive.html' in the same directory as the user_interface.py file. You will need to create these templates and customize them according to your application's design.
